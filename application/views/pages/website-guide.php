<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Starting for the first time or creating a new website is an exciting time! This guide was created to help guide you through our formal process and eliminate any surpirses so we are all on the same page. </p>
<h4>What to expect</h4>
<p><strong>Hiring vs Doing it yourself</strong><br /> There are many advantages to hiring developers to develop your website. Here are a few:
	<ul>
	<li>Developers save you time and the headache of learning code</li>
	<li>Developers are on the leading edge of web development knowledge and practices</li>
	<li>Developers can optimize SEO results and compatibility across browsers</li>
	<li>Developers can offer a lot more customization</li>
	<li>Developers save you from making detrimental mistakes that could be irreversible</li>
</ul>


<strong>Time frame</strong><br />Every website has itâ€™s own timeline needs. A recommend timeline to develop a well polished site is 1-3 months.<br /><br />

<strong>Management</strong><br />There are several ways web site management can be done. The following are ranked by yearly cost in decreasing order.
<ol>
	<li>All management and maintenance can be done by professional developers.</li>
	<li>A combination of a content management system and a set of developers to meet all needs.</li>
	<li>A content management system for the site and no developers. This option restricts exactly what changes can be made since it is not possible to have everything editable.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Costs</strong><br />It is important to note that there are many costs associated with a website. You have the original build, yearly costs, maintenance costs, and any future alterations. Properly budgeting and proceeding with a development that is reflective of these costs is in the best interest of you, your users and us.</p>
